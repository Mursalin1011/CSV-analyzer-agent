# Streamlit UI Fix Summary

## Issue Identified
The Streamlit UI was becoming blank after file upload because the file processing code was placed outside of the tab context, causing display issues.

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Fixed Streamlit App Structure
- Moved all file processing code inside the `tab1` context
- Ensured all UI elements are properly contained within their respective tabs
- Added proper error handling and user feedback

### 2. Improved Import Handling
- Added fallback import mechanisms to handle different execution contexts
- Fixed module path issues that were causing import errors
- Made the app more robust when run from different directories

### 3. Enhanced Error Handling
- Added comprehensive error handling for configuration validation
- Added error handling for analyzer initialization
- Improved user feedback for various error conditions

### 4. Updated Entry Points
- Fixed `run_streamlit.py` to properly call the main function
- Updated `trial1.py` to use the refactored implementation
- Ensured both entry points work correctly

## Key Changes Made

### In `csv_analyzer/ui/streamlit_app.py`:
1. Moved file processing code inside the `tab1` context
2. Added proper error handling and validation
3. Implemented fallback import mechanisms
4. Wrapped the entire app in a `main()` function

### In `csv_analyzer/run_streamlit.py`:
1. Updated to call the `main()` function properly
2. Fixed module path handling

### In `trial1.py`:
1. Updated to use the refactored implementation
2. Fixed import issues

## Verification
The Streamlit app now:
- Properly displays content after file upload
- Maintains tab structure correctly
- Handles errors gracefully
- Works when run from both entry points (`trial1.py` and `csv_analyzer/run_streamlit.py`)
