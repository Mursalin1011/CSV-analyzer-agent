# CSV Analyzer Agent - Summary of Changes

This document summarizes the key changes made to the CSV Analyzer Agent application.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Database Implementation
- Replaced JSON file-based caching with SQLite database
- Created `database.py` with functions for initialization, saving, and loading insights
- Modified `utils.py` to use database functions instead of JSON operations
- Removed dependency on `insights_cache.json` file

### 2. LLM Provider Switching
- Added support for both Google Gemini and Ollama models
- Implemented environment variable-based switching (`LLM_PROVIDER`)
- Updated both `api.py` and `trial1.py` to support both models
- Added `OLLAMA_MODEL` environment variable for Ollama model selection

### 3. Response Format Handling
- Fixed the 'str' object has no attribute 'content' error
- Modified `generate_insights` function to handle different response types
- Added proper checking for `content` attribute in LLM responses
- Ensured compatibility with both Gemini (returns AIMessage) and Ollama (returns string)

### 4. New API Endpoints
- Added `/insights` endpoint to retrieve all cached insights
- Added `/insights/search/{query}` endpoint to search through all insights
- Created appropriate response models for the new endpoints
- Updated API documentation with details about the new endpoints

### 5. Testing
- Created comprehensive test suite in the `tests` directory
- Added tests for both API and Streamlit applications
- Verified functionality with both LLM providers
- Tested database operations and API endpoints
- Added specific tests for the new endpoints

## Configuration

To switch between LLM providers, modify the `.env` file:

### Using Google Gemini (default)
```
LLM_PROVIDER=gemini
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key_here
```

### Using Ollama (local models)
```
LLM_PROVIDER=ollama
OLLAMA_BASE_URL=http://localhost:11434
OLLAMA_MODEL=qwen3:0.6b
```

## Model Response Handling

The application now correctly handles different response formats:
- **Gemini**: Returns `AIMessage` objects with a `content` attribute
- **Ollama**: Returns plain strings directly

The `generate_insights` function checks for the presence of a `content` attribute and handles both cases appropriately.

## Testing

All tests pass successfully with both models:
- Database operations work correctly
- API endpoints function properly
- Both Streamlit and FastAPI applications work with both LLM providers
- Response format handling works for both models
- New endpoints for retrieving all insights and searching insights work correctly
